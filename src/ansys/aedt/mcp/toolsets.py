"""Toolset definitions for PyAnsysMCPService discovery.

Exposes the ``toolsets://definition`` MCP resource that groups every tool
registered on the PyAEDT MCP server into logical, user-facing categories.
Each toolset entry follows the schema agreed across the Ansys MCP family:

``{"name": str, "description": str, "skill": str, "tools": list[str]}``

The catalogue is a pure discovery aid — it does not affect tool visibility,
gating, or runtime behavior. Visibility is still controlled by the existing
``REQUIRES_AEDT_TAG`` / ``aedt_tools`` / ``locked_connection`` tags applied
in :mod:`ansys.aedt.mcp.tools`.
"""

from ansys.aedt.mcp import app

#: Master catalogue mapping every logical toolset to its metadata + tool list.
#: When you register a new tool with ``@app.tool``, add it to one of these
#: toolsets so it is discoverable through ``toolsets://definition``.
